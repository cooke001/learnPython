# learnPython
A project repository for all the practice work from freecodecamp.org's course on python.

I started with this course December 2020 to relearn python for the advent of code challenge after I realised doing it in C was far slower than everyone else.
To anyone who I was on a advent of code league table with, watch out for 2021...
